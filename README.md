ü§ù Symmetric Difference Function

This JavaScript function, diffArray, efficiently calculates the symmetric difference between two arrays. It returns a new array containing all the elements that are present in either of the input arrays, but not in both. This is a fundamental operation for comparing datasets and identifying unique elements.

üöÄ Features

- Symmetric Difference Calculation: Accurately identifies elements unique to each array.

- Array Input: Accepts two arrays as arguments.

- Filter Method: Leverages the built-in filter method for a clean and readable implementation.

- Empty Array Handling: Returns an empty array ([]) if there's no symmetric difference (i.e., the arrays are identical or one is a subset of the other with no unique elements).

üí° How It Works

The diffArray function employs a straightforward yet effective approach:

1. Concatenation: It first merges the two input arrays (arr1 and arr2) into a single array using concat().

2. Filtering: It then iterates through this combined array using filter(). For each element, it checks if that element is not present in arr1 OR not present in arr2.

3. Result: Only elements that satisfy this condition (meaning they exist in one array but not the other) are included in the final returned array.
